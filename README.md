Task 1 : Number Game - This is a number guessing game where the goal is to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game aims to engage players in a fun challenge of guessing the number within a limited number of tries, promoting logical thinking and estimation skills. The option for multiple rounds adds replayability, allowing users to improve their strategies and scores with each attempt.

Here's how it works:

Generating a Random Number: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

User Guess: The user is prompted to enter their guess for the generated number.

Comparison and Feedback: The program compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback - whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Repeating Steps: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the user guesses the correct number or until they exceed the limited number of attempts.

Limited Attempts: The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number, adding a challenge to the game.

Multiple Rounds: After each round, the user is given an option to play again. The game continues until the user chooses to stop playing.

Scoring: The user's score can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won. For instance, fewer attempts or more rounds won can contribute to a higher score.

Task 2 : Student Grade Calculator - This program is designed to calculate total marks, average percentage, and determine grades based on the percentage achieved in various subjects. This program is useful for students to quickly compute their total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grades based on their performance in multiple subjects. It helps in understanding their overall academic performance and provides an overview of their grades across subjects.

Here's how it works:

Input Marks: The user enters the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.

Total Marks Calculation: The program sums up the marks obtained in all subjects to calculate the total marks.

Average Percentage Calculation: The total marks are divided by the total number of subjects to obtain the average percentage.

Grade Assignment: Grades are assigned based on the average percentage achieved. For instance, different percentage ranges can be associated with specific grade categories (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).

Display Results: The program shows the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
