Task 1 : Number Game - This is a number guessing game where the goal is to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game aims to engage players in a fun challenge of guessing the number within a limited number of tries, promoting logical thinking and estimation skills. The option for multiple rounds adds replayability, allowing users to improve their strategies and scores with each attempt.

Here's how it works:

Generating a Random Number: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

User Guess: The user is prompted to enter their guess for the generated number.

Comparison and Feedback: The program compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback - whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Repeating Steps: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the user guesses the correct number or until they exceed the limited number of attempts.

Limited Attempts: The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number, adding a challenge to the game.

Multiple Rounds: After each round, the user is given an option to play again. The game continues until the user chooses to stop playing.

Scoring: The user's score can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won. For instance, fewer attempts or more rounds won can contribute to a higher score.
